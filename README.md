## About Me (in 20 seconds)
I’m a **Technical Lead / Software Integration Engineer** with a strong background in **automotive ECUs, embedded debugging, and virtual platforms**, and I also build **production-ready, full-stack platforms** (mobile + backend + AI services + infra).

I enjoy building systems where **performance, reliability, security, and developer experience** all matter.

---

## What I’m doing now
### In‑House Automotive Signal Analysis Platform (2025 – 2026)
- Replacing commercial tooling (ETAS MDA / ASAM‑MDF workflows) with a **Python-based parsing + analysis stack**
- Designing **high-throughput backends** using multiprocessing, multithreading, ZeroMQ, shared memory, synchronization
- Building a **PyQt oscilloscope-style UI** for real-time visualization and log comparison

---

## Highlights you can see in my GitHub (real production patterns)
### CanFixIt Platform (multi-repo, production mindset)
A full ecosystem that showcases **architecture, documentation, security, streaming, and deployment**:

- **Mobile App (React Native)**: streaming AI chat (SSE), media pipelines, auth flows, and real-world UX patterns  
- **Backend (Node.js)**: REST + WebSockets + Redis + MongoDB + integrations, streaming gateway to Python AI  
- **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: AI orchestration, state management, conversation continuity, WebSockets  
- **AI Support (TypeScript)**: 3-layer architecture (packet → RAG/orchestrator → executor), auditing, RBAC, queues  
- **Infra**: canonical production stack, **Traefik**, automated deployments, guardrails, rollback strategy

> I strongly believe good engineering includes **good documentation** — many of my repos include architecture and implementation reports, security notes, and deployment guides.

---

## Core strengths
- **Automotive Software Bring‑Up & Integration** (GM/Dumarey programmes)
- **Embedded Debugging**: Lauterbach TRACE32, assembly scripting, smoke tests, fault isolation
- **Diagnostics**: UDS (ISO 14229), reprogramming flows, network management
- **Virtual Platforms**: SystemC/TLM vECUs, ISO 26262-3 aligned verification workflows
- **Backend Engineering**: Python + Node.js, Redis/MongoDB, async systems, streaming (SSE/WebSockets)
- **Infra & Delivery**: Docker, CI/CD, service-scoped deploys, production guardrails

---

## Tech I work with
**Languages / Modeling**
- Python, C/C++, SystemC/TLM, Verilog/VHDL, Assembly, Bash, UML

**Automotive / Buses**
- CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet, SPI, UART, OneWire, I2C

**Debug & Tools**
- TRACE32, gdb, Valgrind, CANoe, ETAS INCA, VehicleSpy  
- MATLAB/Simulink, ModelSim, Xilinx ISE, OrCAD PCB, Proteus, CMake  
- Git, Docker, Microservices, Jira, Agile/Scrum

## Featured repositories 
- `canfixit-frontend-react-native` — Mobile app, streaming AI chat, architecture docs
- `canfixit-backend-node` — Node gateway + REST/WebSockets, Redis/MongoDB, streaming endpoints
- `canfixit-backend-python` — FastAPI AI backend, state + conversation continuity patterns
- `canfixit-ai-support` — TypeScript AI support module, RBAC + auditing + queues
- `canfixit-infra` — Production stack: compose + Traefik + automated deployments

---

## Engineering values
- **Performance with predictability** (not just “fast”, but measurable + stable)
- **Security by design** (auth, ownership checks, rate limits, safe defaults)
- **Maintainable architecture** (clear boundaries, docs, DX)
- **Production pragmatism** (observability, rollout safety, rollback paths)

### If you like systems engineering…
- Ask me about: **MDF parsing pipelines**, **high-throughput Python**, **SSE/WebSocket streaming**, **automotive bring-up**, or **virtual ECUs**.

### If you like platform engineering…
- I enjoy: **service-scoped deploys**, **Traefik routing**, **guardrails**, **infra-as-code**, and “boring” reliability work.
